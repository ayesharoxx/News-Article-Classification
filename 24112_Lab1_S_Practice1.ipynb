    "### A Note on Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "Most documents only contain a small subset of the vocabulary, resulting in a very sparse data matrix.\n",
    "To handle the sparsity, in this exercise `data` is represented as a `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`, which can store sparse matrices efficiently while still allowing efficient row-based indexing.\n",
    "You can learn more about `csr_matrix` and other ways of dealing with sparse matrices at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that `data` is **not** a normal NumPy array.\n",
    "While most operations will be the same as with a normal dense array, **you cannot use a sparse matrix to index another matrix**.\n",
    "If you need to do this, either first convert the matrix to a NumPy array with the `toarray()` method, or use methods specifically designed to work with sparse matrices."

The game marked a return to form for Serbian Vlahovic, who has struggled with injuries this season, but made his first league start since October. \n",

    "But Mahomes is unlike any quarterback they faced in 2022.\n",
    "\"Mahomes is the guy that extends the plays and drops the dimes,\" defensive end Brandon Graham, who helped the Eagles to the Lombardi Trophy five years ago, told reporters on Tuesday.\n",
    "\"You've got to make sure you can hit him, get him on the ground, create turnovers, make him make bad throws.\"\n",
    "At just 27-years-old Mahomes has already vaulted himself into the history books, joining future Hall of Famer Drew Brees this year as one of only two quarterbacks to throw for more than 5,000 yards and 40 or more touchdowns in multiple seasons.\n",
    "Eagles linebacker Haason Reddick produced a career-best 16 sacks this season but had few answers when asked how the Eagles could contain Mahomes.\n",

    "Lakers great Abdul-Jabbar, who took the title from Wilt Chamberlain with his signature skyhook on April 5, 1984, sat courtside at Tuesday's game and stood to applaud James after the record was broken.\n",
    "Play was stopped to recognize the achievement and to let James address the crowd.\n",
    "\"I just want to say thank you to the Laker faithful, you guys are one of a kind,\" James said.\n",

    "\"LeBron's pursuit of the scoring record is no exception and billions of people will become aware of this milestone.\"\n",
    "All season long it has been a question of when, not if, James would topple the record. Some thought it may come during Thursday's home game against Milwaukee but James had other ideas.\n",
    "Arriving at the arena in a jet black suit, black shirt and dark sunglasses, James looked like he was going to a funeral.\n",
    "Hours later, he buried Abdul-Jabbar's record.\n",
    "A deafening roar greeted him during the pre-game introductions and another came when he buried a three-pointer five minutes into the opening quarter for his first points of the night.\n",
    "He cut the number he needed to single digits on a straightway three in the second half that sent fans leaping from their seats before the 21-foot, history-making bucket arrived with 10 seconds remaining in the third quarter.\n",
    "\"It's so surreal, because it's something I never made a goal of mine or something I set out to do,\" James said after the game. \"It just happened.\"\n",
    "Drafted into the league as a teenager, the Akron, Ohio native has more than delivered on the massive expectations put on his broad shoulders at a young age.\n",
    "A versatile forward, he helping usher in the era of position-less basketball, winning four titles with three different teams, four MVP awards and four Finals MVP awards.\n",
    "James sits top of the regular season points list followed by Abdul-Jabbar with Utah Jazz great Karl Malone (36,928), late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant (33,643) and Chicago Bulls icon Michael Jordan (32,292) rounding out the top five.\n",
    "\"When I read about the history of the game I never thought that this record would ever be touched,\" James said.\n",
    "\"I just didn't think nobody would have that type of longevity to come out on the floor and play at that level for so long.\n",
    "\"So it's just a complete honor to be a part of this league, to be a part of some of the greats that have ever played this game and to be right at the apex with them.\"\n",
    "Last month, the 38-year-old was named to a record-tying 19th All Star game, a mark also held by Abdul-Jabbar.\n",
    "\"For sure I know I can play a couple more years,\" James said.\n",
    "\"The way I'm feeling, the way my body has been reacting to me throughout the course of this season, I know I can play a couple more years.\n",
    "\"It's all about my mind. My mind is still into it and I am still motivated to go out and try to compete for championships because I feel like that's what I can still do.\"\n",
